/*
This file illustrates how to run and test the TCP Simple Broadcast Chat Server and Client
*/


ROLE OF ASSIGNMENT COMPLETION:
This project aims to complete a TCP Simple Broadcast Chat Server and Client system using socket programming.
In this case, Yinan is responsible for developing the client and test cases;
              Liuyi is responsible for implementing the server.


ARCHITECTURE:
This program assignment consists of two parts: server, client
server:
in server.c file, we have sendACK(), sendNAK(), which can confirm or reject requests from clients
username_check(), which can check if the client name already exists;
connection_check(), which can check if the number of clients exceed limits.

client:
in client.c file, we have
getServerMessage(), which can get message from the server such as ACK, NAK, ONLINE and OFFLINE;
join(), which can initiate a JOIN with the server;
chat(), which can send messages to server and broadcast to other clients.


USAGE:
1. compile server.c, client.c
make

2. run the server first
./Server <server_ip_address> <port_no.> <max_clients>

3. run the client secondly
./Client <username> <server_ip_address> <port_no.>
you should see
client: connecting to 127.0.0.1
connected to the server..

4. now the TCP Simple Broadcast Chat Server and Client is established
