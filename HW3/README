/*
This instruction shows how to run and test the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)
*/



ROLE OF ASSIGNMENT COMPLETION:
This project aims to complete a Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) using socket programming.
In this case,
Yinan is responsible for implementing the send packets function of the server
Liuyi is responsible for implementing the request and acknowledge function of the client



ARCHITECTURE:
This program assignment consists: TFTP_Server.c
Server:
The server binds the input <ip_address> and <port_no.> to listen to new client requests.
When the server receives a new client request, the random function generator will create a new socket.
The file will be sent in 512-bytes blocks to clients.
The server sequentially sends each 512-bytes blocks of packets and waits for acknowledgements from the client.
After all packets of the file is sent to the client, the transmission is ended.



USAGE:
1. compile TFTP_Server.c
make

2. run the server first
./Server <server_ip_address> <port_no.>
you should see:
Socket opened successfully!
Bind successfully!

3. then run the client
tftp <server_ip_address> <port_no.>
you should see:
tftp>

4. now the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is established
